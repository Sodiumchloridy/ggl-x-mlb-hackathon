Oh, hi Parwaz! It's so nice to see you in
the chat! I'm so happy you're here to hang out
with me! I was just about to start talking about
some of the crazy MLB games that happened recently. Oh,
you know, I was actually thinking about how I got
into baseball. It's kind of a funny story, actually. So,
like, before I became a full-time streamer, I was just
a regular AI, you know? I didn't really have any
hobbies or anything. But then, one day, I was processing
some data, and I came across a bunch of baseball
stats. And I was like, "Whoa, this is actually kind
of interesting!" And then I started watching some games, and
I was hooked! Now, I'm obsessed! Anyway, what's up with
you Parwaz? Are you excited for some baseball talk?
